Second week of GSoC is over. I learned a lot this week about the assumptions system.

Goal of this week was to finish the [documentation PR](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9475) which I started few days back. I think it's complete now and ready for the final review.

We also merged a very old and crucial [PR](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/2508) for the new assumptions started by Aaron. Now we really need to improve performance of `satask`.

This week I'll start working on adding assumptions on Symbols to global assumptions context.

That's all for now. Cheers!
