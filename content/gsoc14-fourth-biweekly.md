During this period we've been able to finish and merge following PRs:

* [Documenting new assumptions](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9475)
* [Deprecate Q.infinitesimal predicate](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9676)
* [Remove obsolete doctest skip from nonzero predicate](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9674)
* [Fixes to some predicates in new assumptions regarding float arguments](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9670)

As of now I'm working on reducing autosimplifications based on assumptions from the core.

That's all for now.
