The first week ended few days back. I managed to do few things during this period.

I finished [#9228](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9228) and got it merged into the master. I also started working on [documenting new assumptions](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/9475). Thanks to Aaron for quick feedback on that.

There are few hiccups in the latter one. After changing all predicate keys to `property`, some of them started giving `None` when used in `ask`. I hope that I'll be able to sort it out before Monday.

I'm also looking forward to merge [#2508](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/2508) this week. You are welcome to help me in reviewing this one.

I'll start working on global assumptions once I'm done with the documentation.

That's all for now. Cheers!
