I am Sudhanshu Mishra. I like working on Android apps and cloud computing. I also contribute to an open source project SymPy which is a computer algebra system written in pure Python. You can know more about the projects done by me on my GitHub profile.

I like listening to music especially by A.R. Rehman, The Beatles, Eagles and Led Zeppelin. Iâ€™m a Hacker news addict and also spend a lot of my time on Reddit.

I am not available to hire at the moment.
